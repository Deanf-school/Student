Hello my name is dean and i'll be going over the progress I made during this blog thing
This process was extremly diffcult, for most of my time, i couldn't even figure out how to make the blog page until i got help and realized that it was because i didn't add the .MD suffix. After that it was pretty easy, just interting changes saving and commiting. 

I am working with roger.

**STEP ONE** 

First I made the github account 

**STEP TWO** 

Then i made the reprository and then did the basic stuff
